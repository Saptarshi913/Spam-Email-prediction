# Spam-Email-prediction
This project implements a machine learning-based spam email classifier using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and the Multinomial Naïve Bayes algorithm. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of emails, which are categorized as either spam or non-spam (ham). The text preprocessing pipeline includes removal of stopwords, text normalization using regular expressions, and vectorization using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method. Exploratory data analysis is performed using pie charts and word clouds to visualize the distribution and common spam keywords. The dataset is split into training and test sets, and the Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier is trained to learn the patterns in spam messages. Model performance is evaluated using confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report, demonstrating effective classification of spam emails. The final model is capable of predicting whether a given email message is spam based on learned textual features.
